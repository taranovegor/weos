# weOS
System for wristwatches based on Arduino

This repository contains nothing more than children's creativity üôÇ.
The development was carried out in 2015-2017 and its goal was a cheap alternative to electronic wristwatches.

The project was brought to a working prototype, but without a body, since it was not possible to obtain a satisfactory printing result.

Later, more advanced components were purchased for the project, and it was decided to refactor the existing source code, but due to lack of time, the project remained at the idea stage.

[Prototyping photos](pics/README.md) available.

## Schematic & Layout Design
I couldn't find the files, I think they were lost üò¢. All that remains is a photo of the developed printed circuit board. As far as I know, it was developed in [DipTrace](https://diptrace.com/) or Sprint Layout.

## 3D Model
The 3D models was developed using the [–ö–æ–º–ø–∞—Å-3D](https://kompas.ru/).
