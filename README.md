## 3D Model
The 3D models was developed using the [–ö–æ–º–ø–∞—Å-3D](https://kompas.ru/).

## Schematic & Layout Design
I couldn't find the files, I think they were lost üò¢. All that remains is a photo of the developed printed circuit board. As far as I know, it was developed in [DipTrace](https://diptrace.com/) or Sprint Layout.
